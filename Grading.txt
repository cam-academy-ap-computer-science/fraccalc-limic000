Extra Credit Error Handling: 1/4

You properly reported an error on 3 / 0.  But, not on 3/0 * 1.
You didn't report errors on 1 ++ 2 or 3_3_3 / 1 either.  So,
just one point of extra credit.  But your code is of excellent
quality, well organized.  This is top-notch work.  I wish my
employees wrote such well-organized, well-structured code.  Well done!
